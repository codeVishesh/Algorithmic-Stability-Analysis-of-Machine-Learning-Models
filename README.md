# Algorithmic Stability Analysis of Machine Learning Models

This project studies how stable different machine learning models are
when the training data is slightly perturbed.

## How to Run
1. Create a virtual environment (optional)
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run:
   python main.py

Outputs will be saved in the `results/` folder.
